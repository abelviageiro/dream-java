- The actual architecture has a problem in the implementation of glitch-freedom (see ExampleGlitch).
  Imagine a diamond:
  
  B = f(A)
  C = f(B)
  D = f(B, C)
  
  B and C receive 3 events from A and change their value (three times).
  When D receives the first event from B and C, it uses the current values stored in B and C,
  which might be the ones generated by subsequent events.
  
  We need to prevent B and C from accepting further events in such cases.

- Can we create a proxy to a method (not to an object)?
- Can we consider methods with parameters?
- Can we define constraints on the return values of methods?
